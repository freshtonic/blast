# Blast!

Blast is the embryonic beginnings of a top down arena-style multiplayer
spaceship battle, inspired by Bratwurst on the Amiga 500.

It's an HTML 5 web app that uses matter.js for physics and three.js for
rendering. 

A serverside Node app manages the network comms for multiplayer.

It's basic and buggy right now, but contributions are most welcome!

Blast! was conceived of and hacked on at RailsCamp NZ 2014 at Mt. Cheeseman by
James Sadler (@freshtonic), Matt Wratt (@mwratt) and Ben Tillman (@warp), and in
true RailsCamp tradition, there's not a single shred of Ruby or Rails in it!
